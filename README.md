# Merge Sort Algorithm in C

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C using recursion. Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity.

## Features
- Recursive merge sort implementation
- Works on integer arrays of any size
- Efficient and fast for large datasets

## How to Run

```bash
gcc merge_sort.c -o merge_sort
./merge_sort
